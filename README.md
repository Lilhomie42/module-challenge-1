# recftor-web

## Description

AS A student of coding bootcamp student
I WANT to view and refactor the exiting code follows accessibility standards for a marketing agency
SO THAT the site can optimized for search engines.

Refactoring existing code (improving it without changing what it does) to meet a certain set of standards or to implement a new technology. Given the ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA provided via gitlab.

While I was refactoring I applied the scouting rule the index.html and style.css code without losing the existing functionality of the website. Also noticed on the starter code contained lots of div tags which is known as a div soup. By avoiding this conflict I replaced all the div tags with semantic HTML tags to specify differnt parent and child element nesting within each sections. Also some of the starter code for css had repetitive properties and values just differnt assigned selectors. So I decided to group the selectors with the same properties and values.
